You can ask what they would like the user interface to be? Anything on top of just a simple screen with a section showing the camera input, and some sound or buzzing when books are out of order
Boss mentioned that the top priority should be efficient shelf reading. Simply shelf reading as quick as possible. That would be the most used function

Some ideas and tasks:
Create algorithm to determine order
Successfully and with ease read in a call number to the camera, compare it with the previous, and alert user of its correctness
Create a start-up screen
Create an elegant UI for the camera process
Tell user where incorrectly shelved book should go (like say move this book back 3 spaces to the after this certain book)
