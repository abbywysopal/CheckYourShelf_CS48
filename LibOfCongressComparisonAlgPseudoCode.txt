Public int compareTo (other) {
	Mylineone, mylinetwo, mylinethree;
	Otherlineone, otherlinetwo, otherlinethree;

	Split lineones by letter
	(is L greater than or less than LA? Jk yes it is i found online)
	For each letter from left to right, looping num times of least num letters between mine and other:
		If my letter greater than other letter, return 1 (my is greater)

	Split linetwos by character
	Convert to ints, b/c these always just numbers
	If my num greater than other num, return 1 (my is greater);

	Split linetwos by character
	For each character that is a letter:
		If my char is greater (earlier in alphabet) than others, mine is greater, return one;
	For each char that is a number (if all the letters were the same)
		Compare as decimal
		(look at each num from left to right. If mine is bigger return one. If all the same
		But one of the numbers has trailing ints, then the one with trailing is bigger)


	If all this is still equal, look at last line
	According to library of congress website this will be year of publication? So simply see if 
	Mine is bigger. If so return 1 if not return -1.
	If all this equal return 0 because equal.
