## What is it?
CheckYourShelf is a library administration tool developed by UCSB students in conjunction with UCSB library staff. Through the use of [Google's Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/), library employees can use their phones to scan books that must be borrowed or were placed out of order on the shelf.
