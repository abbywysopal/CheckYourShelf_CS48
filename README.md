# CheckYourShelf_CS48


## What is it?
CheckYourShelf is a library administration tool developed by UCSB students in conjunction with UCSB library staff. Through the use of [Google's Text Vision API](https://developers.google.com/vision/text-overview), library employees can use their phones to scan books that must be borrowed or were placed out of order on the shelf.
